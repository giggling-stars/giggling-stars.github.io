		<h1>
			I love being an amateur
		</h1>

		<p> People usually admire me for how quickly I learn new things </p>
		<p> But I always find it hard </p>
		<p> I love to learn. I love getting lost in a new hobby with lots of things to learn and master </p>
		<p> But in my endless burning passion for my new obsession, I rush into learning every little detail, until I exhaust it of all it's mystery, and it becomes just a another cyclic hobby for me</p>
		<p> In no way am I a master of all my hobbies, but I just feel like there's less to learn and discover </p>
		<p> Maybe that's all I want. </p>
		<p> Something to discover. </p>
